Be aware! Bcon is my first trial with Git.
I'm learning a lot from others on the net and learned with GIT you can give some coding-time back to everyone.
The code I write is mostly at night.
So when I read it back with daylight, I do see a lot of improvement, as will you :)

As a network engineer, I'm working with communication devices every-day.
For hobby I like to build electrical stuff, sometimes with some intelligence.
As automation / intelligence requires power, I need to communicate between low-power devices and a central brain.

Most of my projects contain an ATmega chip.
To share their functions, I need to let them communicate with others.
I've experimented with a few radio's and found out the cc1101 is the best sub-1Ghz radio I found (for now :)
