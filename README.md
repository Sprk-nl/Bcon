Be aware! Bcon is my first trial with Git :)

As a network engineer, I'm working with communication devices every-day.
For hobby I like to build electrical stuff with some intelligence.

Most of my projects contain an ATmega chip. 
These chips are great for a touch and feel in the physical world.
To share their functions, I need to let them communicate with others.
I've experimented with a few radio's and found out the cc1101 is the best radio in my situation (for now :)

I'm learning a lot from others on the net and want to give my piece of coding-time back to you.
The code I write is mostly at night, so when I read it back at daylight, I do see a lot of improvement.

Hope to find some other fellow radio geeks out there!
