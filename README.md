Be aware! Bcon is my first trial with Git :)
I'm learning a lot from others on the net and want to give my piece of coding-time back to you.
The code I write is mostly at night.
when I read it back with daylight, I do see a lot of improvement.

As a network engineer, I'm working with communication devices every-day.
For hobby I like to build electrical stuff with some intelligence.

Most of my projects contain an ATmega chip. 
These chips are great for a touch and feel in the physical world.
To share their functions, I need to let them communicate with others.
I've experimented with a few radio's and found out the cc1101 is the best radio I found (for now :)


Hope to find some other fellow radio/communication geeks out there!
